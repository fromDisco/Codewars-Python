# Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.
# 
# The function should take three arguments - 
# operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
# The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

def basic_op(operator, value1, value2):
    return eval(str(value1) + operator + str(value2))
